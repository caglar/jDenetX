# This file stores the properties used by the default models panel 
# to determine which .model.xml default model lists to include.  It 
# also stores lists of regular expressions that are used to prune 
# the default lists as specified by the user.
#
# ONE VERY IMPORTANT CAVEAT! While the ability to use regular 
# expressions is a nice and powerful way to specify model strings
# you should try not to use commas fillowed by a space: ", " in
# these regexp's since that's what the properties are being split
# apart with when they are parsed at run time.
